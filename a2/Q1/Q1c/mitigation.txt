Use prepared statement:

Steps:
1. create statement template which contains parameters that should be user input
2. DBMS compiles the statement template
3. when user input is givn, the DBMS will execute the statement with the input.

Since the statemnet is pre-cimpiled, the input will be treated as parameter instead of command. So even if 
user input contains SQL commands, it will not be executed.

Please note, we need to use the user input as parameter instead of concating user input as a string. otherwise
SQL injections are still possible.
