Since database already contains malicious code and we cant modify that, we need to change the way that html being generated.
By using HTML eascping. 
There are some characters that are commonly used in JS malicious code eg: (& < > " ' / ;). If we could escape those characters, the js code
wont be able to be executed. We may want to do HTML eascping in all sections that we dont want any JS code to execued eg. comment, post and etc.
And we may also want to check for extra js code hidden in <a>/ <href> tags and linsteners. For link, we may do a whitelist or just disable all 
encoded string.
